## 📝 Summary
Today I learned the foundational principles of cybersecurity:

- **CIA Triad** ensures:
  - **Confidentiality**: Data is accessible only to authorized users.
  - **Integrity**: Data remains accurate and unaltered.
  - **Availability**: Systems and data are accessible when needed.

- **Threats vs Vulnerabilities vs Risks**:
  - Threat: Anything that can exploit a vulnerability.
  - Vulnerability: Weakness in a system.
  - Risk: Likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

- **Security Layers**:
  - Physical
  - Network
  - Application
  - Operational
  - End-user awareness
